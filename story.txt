Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Chris,

I am writing to you from a delicious spaceship in a wide galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a blue rocket in November. There are 9999 snakes and plants of dogs here! In the
123 there is a pool full of Mercury. I fall asleep each night on a fun bed of
metal and dream of hiking slowly. It feels as though I have lived here for
10 years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
riding on a colorful unicorn!!

Best wishes,
Chris
